# My White Bread Loaf

## Take 1: Warming the yeast

###

- 400g Tesco strong white flour
- 8g table salt
- 7g Allison's Easy-Bake yeast
- 25g unsalted butter, softened
- 250ml warm water
- Olive oil, for proofing

### What I did

1. Warm the KitchenAid bowl with boiling water for a minute.
2. Pour away the water in the bowl and add the warm water and yeast. 
3. Stir with a whisk to dissolve the yeast. 
4. Put the bowl under the KitchenAid and add the dough hook. 
5. Pour the flour, salt and butter into the bowl. 
6. Turn the KitchenAid speed up to 2 and leave for 10 minutes.
7. Put some oil on your hand, take the dough off the hook and roll into a ball then put back into the KitchenAid bowl and clingfilm and leave to proof for 3 hours.
8. Put magic mat at the base of a loaf tin (what size?) and oiled the sides of the tin with olive oil.
9. Floured wooden chopping board, rolled dough out of bowl and knocked back gently.
10. Rolled into sausage shape and then put in the loaf tin with the seal at the bottom. 
11. Covered with clingfilm and left to proof again for 1 hour.
12. Pre-heat the oven to 220ºC and put a baking tray at the bottom to hold water. 
13. Slash the top lengthwise with a sharp knife (used a sharp pairing knife).
14. Boil some water and pour a full kettle of water into the tray.
15. Sprinkle over some flour and put in the oven for 30 mins.

### Notes

- Type of flour used was Tesco Strong White Bread Flour
- House temperature is 19.5ºC @ 8:00 rising to 20.5ºC @ 10:30
- Proofing from 8:00-11:00
- KitchenAid bowl was almost clean with a few remnants around the sides. 
- The dough was slightly sticky, where holding it for too long would require some effort in getting it off but would generally come off clean. It required realtively quick hands to stop it sticking a little olive oil helped to keep it from sticking. 
- The date is 11th May 2018, which may have an effect on end result (can check each month for variances in bread)
- The second proof started at 11:00 and the temperature in the house was 20.5ºC
- After the second proof the dough was still sticky to touch and was not springy as Paul had mentioned. 
- Scoring with a very sharp pairing knife just pulled the bread rather than cut. This could be because the dough was too wet but it could also be because I used a pairing knife when I should have used a sharp serrated knife like Paul said to use. 
- The oven took a whole 15 minutes to come up to 220ºC, which is worth bearing in mind.
- Dough wasn't appearing to rise much in the oven.
- The dough did not rise at all in the oven and the bread felt dense and when tapped there was a thud rather than a hollow sound. 
- The smell was lovely.
- The flavour of the bread was lovely, especially with butter but the texture was dense and the dough felt under cooked. 
- The crust was wonderful, very light and springy but also crisp. 

### Things to change for next time

#### Fermentation temperature

According to this website the optimum temperature for proving (sour dough) bread is 27ºC and Paul Hollywood expects proofing of this dough misture to be between 1-3 hours for it to double in size. After 3 hours it should have doubled - I don't think this has. Therefore, I can only surmise that that temperature for the fermentation was not high enough.

So next time I should try preheating the oven to around 30ºC and then turning it off and putting the dough in the over to proof.

#### Sugar

I didn't put any sugar in this recipe because Paul Hollywood's 'Basic White Tin Bread' recipe does not have any in it. However, yeast feeds off sugar to release carbon dioxide, which helps the bread to rise so adding some in at the beginning will speed up the rising process.

So another time I need to add sugar to see the difference. 

#### Fermentation time

Finally, it is possible to leave dough to rise in the fridge overnight and this can lead to a more sour bread

## Take 2: Increasing the proving temperature

### Ingredients
- 400g Tesco Strong White Flour
- 7g Allison's Easy-Bake Yeast
- 8g table salt
- 250ml warm water
- 25g salted butter, softened

### Notes
- Dough went into oven at 31ºC
- Put dough into oiled metal bowl instead of using the KitchenAid bowl (mainly so that I can reuse the KitchenAid)
- Dough was slightly sticky again
- Put yeast into warm water in the KitchenAid bowl and dissolved before putting the other ingredients on top.
- After 1 hour the temperature was down to 27ºC but the bread was not doubled in size. 
- Rolled and put in tin, left for 2.5 hours, still not doubled in size. 
- Put in oven for 30 mins. 
- Bread similar to first attempt, hadn't risen, very dense, nice crust, flavour was good, threw in bin. 

## Take 3: Using cool water with the easy bake yeast

This time I put the yeast in as instructed by Paul Hollywood and the tin from Allison's Easy Bake Yeast. Turns out for easy-bake/fast-action/instant yeast you do not need to warm it up first. 

Everything else stayed the same. 

Unfortunately the end result was exactly the same as the other two. The bread didn't rise one iota and that made me sad. 

One weekend of baking down, 3 flat and ruined loafs, what have I learnt from this? I've made some changes to the technique for making bread and none of them have made a difference to the proving of the bread. Therefore there must be something in the ingredients that is stopping the bread from rising. Of course, yeast makes the bread rise so this is a good place to start. As I've already mentioned the right temperature for yeast to work is around 27ºC but changing the temp didn't work. We also know that salt plays a part in counteracting the yeast, but then I've been following a recipe by Paul Hollywood, who you would think knows his stuff so I doubt the salt is the problem. Finally, using the correct temperature to start the yeast off hasn't made a difference, when following the instructions on the tin or Paul Hollywood. So my only conclusion is there is something wrong with the yeast. 

### My realisation

I have suddenly had a realisation, the yeast that I was using was opened about a year ago and has been sat in my cupboard unused since then. I had a look on the tin and it says once opened use within 4 months. Now I am beginning to understand why my bread did not work at all. The yeast was dead. 

So, next weekend it will be a trip to the shops to buy some new yeast!

## Take 4: Using a freshly bought easy bake yeast

Added new yeast and the bread after the first proof was double in size after only an hour.
Temperature was around 27ºC for the entire time of the proof. 

The dough was incredibly light, soft and supple to touch and knock back. 
After the second proof the dough had doubled again and was ready to be baked.

I baked the bread at 230ºC for 30 minutes with a kettle of water bubbling away in the bottom of the oven to create a steamy environment so that the bread wouldn't crisp up too much.

The bread was super light for a sandwich, to the point where making a heavy tuna mayo and salad sandwich for lunch would cause the bread to collapse by 12 o'clock, wrapped in foil and plonked in a fridge. As a fresh sandwich it was delicious and soft, and as toast later in the day it was sublimely crispy and light, almost as perfect as Artisan for having butter and apricot jam on. 

The crust was too burnt and the curst was too crispy, need to figure out how to make a soft bread loaf (damp towel when it is resting maybe?). Wrapping the bread in a tea-towel to preserve seemed to help it with softening the crust. Even wrapping in a tea-towel kept the bread soft on the edges when toast was called for in the evening.
