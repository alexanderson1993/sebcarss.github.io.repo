Here is my list of bread variables to play with and my starting recipe. 

- Ingredients (measurements)
    - Flour
    - Water
    - Yeast
    - Salt
    - Sugar
    - Oil
    - Milk
    - Butter
    - Flavourings (seeds, nuts, fruit, etc)
- Techniques
    - How warm the water is
    - Where to add the yeast to, e.g. water, flour?
    - How long to knead
    - What speed to knead at
    - How long to proof
    - Proof in: metal bowl with clingfilm, proofing basket with tea towel, etc. 
    - Double proof?
    - Proof temperature
    - Oven temperature
    - Type of loaf created: box loaf, cob, baguette, etc.
    - Time in oven

# My White Bread Loaf

## Ingredients

- 400g strong white flour
- 8g salt
- 7g instant yeast
- 25g unsalted butter, softened
- 250ml warm water
- Olive oil, for proofing

## What I did

1. Warm the KitchenAid bowl with boiling water for a minute.
2. Pour away the water in the bowl and add the warm water and yeast. 
3. Stir with a whisk to dissolve the yeast. 
4. Put the bowl under the KitchenAid and add the dough hook. 
5. Pour the flour, salt and butter into the bowl. 
6. Turn the KitchenAid speed up to 2 and leave for 10 minutes.
7. Put some oil on your hand, take the dough off the hook and roll into a ball then put back into the KitchenAid bowl and clingfilm and leave to proof for 3 hours.

## Notes

- House temperature is 19.5ºC @ 8:00 rising to 20.5ºC @ 10:30
- Proofing from 8:00-11:00
- KitchenAid bowl was almost clean with a few remnants around the sides. 
- The dough was slightly sticky, where holding it for too long would require some effort in getting it off but would generally come off clean. It required realtively quick hands to stop it sticking a little olive oil helped to keep it from sticking. 
- The date is 11th May 2018, which may have an effect on end result (can check each month for variances in bread)

## Things to change for next time

According to this website the optimum temperature for proofing (sour dough) bread is 27ºC and Paul Hollywood expects proofing of this dough misture to be between 1-3 hours for it to double in size. After 3 hours it should have doubled - I don't think this has. Therefore, I can only surmise that that temperature for the fermentation was not high enough.

So next time I should try preheating the oven to around 30ºC and then turning it off and putting the dough in the over to proof.
