# My White Bread Loaf

## Ingredients

- 400g strong white flour
- 8g salt
- 7g instant yeast
- 25g unsalted butter, softened
- 250ml warm water
- Olive oil, for proofing

## What I did

1. Warm the KitchenAid bowl with boiling water for a minute.
2. Pour away the water in the bowl and add the warm water and yeast. 
3. Stir with a whisk to dissolve the yeast. 
4. Put the bowl under the KitchenAid and add the dough hook. 
5. Pour the flour, salt and butter into the bowl. 
6. Turn the KitchenAid speed up to 2 and leave for 10 minutes.
7. Put some oil on your hand, take the dough off the hook and roll into a ball then put back into the KitchenAid bowl and clingfilm and leave to proof for 3 hours.

## Notes

- House temperature is 19.5ÂºC
- Proofing from 8:00-11:00
- KitchenAid bowl was almost clean with a few remnants around the sides. 
- The dough was slightly sticky, where holding it for too long would require some effort in getting it off but would generally come off clean. It required realtively quick hands to stop it sticking a little olive oil helped to keep it from sticking.
